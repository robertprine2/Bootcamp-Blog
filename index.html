		<h1>Bootcamp Blog</h1>
		<h2>Who am I?</h2>
			<p>	Hi! My name is Robert Prine and I didn't really have a great idea of what a blog was before tonight. I have worked in elementary education for the past nine years and decided that I needed a change of pace. The change of pace that I am talking about is a way to make more money than what daycare costs, which is the reason why I am currently a stay at home dad.</p>
			<p>Through Hour of Code I discovered that I had a genuine interest in coding and I decided to take a leap and sign up for this UCF Coding Bootcamp that you are about to read about, unless of course you decide to close this tab and look for something else to read about. :)</p>
			<p>
		<h2>Why am I writing this blog?</h2>
			<p>	There are several reasons why I am writing this blog. First and foremost is that it gives me practice writing code in HTML. In addition, I am able to keep notes of what I am learning all in one area. Lastly, someone told me that employers in the tech industry like it when applicants have blogs. I did this for you, future employer. :)</p>
		<h2>Why should you read this blog?</h2>
			<p>	The main reason that I wanted to take a bootcamp over self teaching was because I didn't really know where to start. There are so many different things to learn about coding and anything tech related that it is hard to know where to start and what is important. My hope is that this blog will allow you to use it as a timeline to know where to start and how to progress if you would like to become a full stack web developer. The curriculum will be laid out for you and all you will need to do is practice and look up videos or web tutorials about the topics that are covered throughout the boot camp. I am saving you $9,500. You are welcome! :)</p>
		<h3>March 29, 2016</h3>
		<h4>First day of class</h4>
		<h5>Introductions</h5>
			<p>Everyone got the chance to introduce themselves, but I had trouble remembering anything from this since it was information overload. I do know the names of the two people sitting beside me though! :)</p>
		<h5>What is a fullstack developer?</h5>
			<p>A fullstack developer is someone who can develop both the front end and back end of a website. The front end is what website visitors see and interact with. The back end is how the website collects data to allow the front end to interact with the rest of the web.</p>
		<h5>Terminal commands are awesome!</h5>
			<p>cd "name"= change directory This allows you to move to a directory through steps.</p>
			<p>cd ~ = changes your directory to your home directory</p>
			<p>cd explore . = takes you to your current directory in an explorer window</p>
			<p>mkdir "name" = make a directory with that name</p>
			<p>ls = list all folders in your current directory.</p>
			<p>You can use tab as you are typing to autocomplete your folder to avoid typing mistakes</p>
			<p>pwd = Tells you the complete path to what folder you are currently in</p>
			<p>touch "name.html" = creates an empty file in your current directory</p>
			<p>rm "name" = remove the file name from your current directory</p>rm -r = removes the folder and everything inside it</p>
		<h5>Insights from Will (the person to my left)</h5>
			<p>Stack exchange allows you to find answers or answer questions about almost anything you could possibily think of. Stack overflow is a part of stack exchange.</p>
		<h5>Hello, HTML</h5>
			<p>&lt;!DOCTYPE html> This tells you what type of document you are making. In this case it is an html document</p>
			<p>&lt;html></html> This is where your entire web page will go (in between the tags).</p>
			<p>&lt;head></head> This is where you will put code that will change the style of the page and the title on the dragable bar on top of the web page</p>
			<p>&lt;title></title> This goes in the head tag and is what is written on the top of the web page</p>
			<p>&lt;body></body> This is where you add the text, pictures, links, etc on your webpage</p>
			<p>&lt;h1></h1> These are the headings which go into the body tag of hte html. h1 is the largest heading and it goes down all the way to h6.</p>
			<p>&lt;img src="weblink to the image" alt="text to discribe picture"> This shows an image on your webpage and doesn't have a closing tag. The alt allows you to give a discription that show up when you hover over the picture. We were having a problem in class with the alt function of the image not working when you hover over it. I was told that they would get back to us and it might just be a new addition to chrome where it only appears or is read if you have a screen reader enabled.</p>
			<p>&lt;a href="link you want to link to">link name</a> This is a link tag that can be placed in paragraphs over pictures wherever. In this case there will be the words "link name" that will link to a website.</p>
			<p>&lt;a href="URL" target="_blank">link text</a> = This will make a link that will open the link in a new tab.</p>
			<p>&lt;a href="#">link text</a> = This is a place holder link and doesn't take you anywhere...yet.</p>
			<p>&lt;br> = skips a line or line break</p>
			<p>&amp;lt; = This can be used in html to allow you to actually type "<" on the webpage. These are called "character entities" and they allow you to avoid making code that html reads in the wrong way instead of just typing it on the page. If you do a websearch for "character entities" it will bring up lists of the different code for each symbole.</p>
		<h4>Overall thoughts on the class</h4>
			<p>	I enjoyed the class tonight mainly because it is new and I got a chance to meet and talk with adults. This is especially true since I have only been able to talk to a nine month old son and an almost three year old daughter for the past two weeks since I have been stuck at home due to my sprained ankle.</p>
			<p>	Everyone seemed nice. It could have been the fact that I had the crutch, but I think they were all genuine. I enjoyed how the instructors would joke around as well. All in all, I am very excited about moving forward in the class. It will be a fun learning experience and I love to prove myself when I have competition, even though I know we are supposed to be working together. I just get a lot more drive and motivation when I compare myself to others.</p>
			<p>	I did feel that the introductions were a bit of an overload for me, but it is important to build community in a classroom. I just have trouble with names and when I hear a lot of stories they start to blend together. I have a better chance of remembering people if I am given the information in chunks. I can't complain much though, since this is exactly how I did it when I taught.</p>
			<p>	The pace of the material was perfect for beginers and with the TAs circling the room you could get individual questions answered quickly. I knew most of the information covered tonight, so I kind of wanted to go through it faster, but I did try to get a head start before the bootcamp started. I think that when we start covering material that I don't have any knowledge of the pace will be perfect.</p>
			<p>	Overall, I am excited and can't wait until Thursday (the second class).</p>
		<h3>March 31, 2016</h3>
		<h4>Second day of class!</h4>
		<h5>Get Git</h5>
			<p>Git is a type of version control that allows you to go back to previous version if you make mistakes. It also allows a group of people to work on the same file at the same time without hindering eachother. </p>
			<p>The major benefits from using git are code conflict resolution (you can see what has been changed in your file for easy changes when mistakes are made) and version history (allows you to keep track of all of the changes that are made to your file since it began).</p>
			<p>GitHub is the website that allows you to create git repositories without using your own server. It is open source, which means that anyone can see your code, unless you pay a monthly fee.</p>
		<h5>Get Commands</h5>
			<p>git clone url_from_GitHub = copies an entire repository</p>
			<p>git add file_name = adds a file or changes to a future commit</p>
			<p>git commit -m = notes a change to the local repository (if you get stuck because you didn't use -m use :q to quit and get back to gitbash)</p>
			<p>git push = sends changes to hosting service (GitHub)</p>
			<p>git pull = downloads refreshed version of the repository</p>
